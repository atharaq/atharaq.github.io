# Final Project

Here are some initial topics to think about:

* Applications of regular expressions (lexical analysis / tokenization) and grammars (parsing / abstract syntax trees) in compilers.
* Lambda calculus. This was a mathematical description of "computable functions" developed by Alonzo Church simultaneously to Turing. Explain what they are, show that they can express exactly the computable functions and vice versa (every computable function can be expressed using the lambda calculus, etc). Discuss applications, in particular functional programming languages.
* NP Completeness. We will be studying this concept in our class, but there are many NP complete problems that one could study. Find an NP complete problem, explain why it's NP-complete (explain what that means), find some algorithms that solve that problem, etc.
* Computable real numbers, computable functions between real numbers, and computable notions of continuity and calculus. This is most often referred to as "computable analysis". What does it mean for a real number (an infinite sequence of digits) to be computable? What does it mean for a function between computable numbers to be computable? Surprisingly, in "computable analysis", all functions are continuous! Explain these kinds of results for computable analysis, and also explain why philosophers study this (this often comes up in the "constructivist" ontology of mathematics).
* Quantum algorithms. Which problems can be decided by a "quantum computer"? Are they the same as the problems that can be solved by a Turing Machine? What about complexity: are problems with "quantum polynomial time" the same as the problems in "polynomial time"? What are the "quantum" versions of the normal complexity classes?
* Probabilistic algorithms. Similar questions to above.

The idea of the project is to research one of these topics as a group, explain it to the rest of us at a high level in your presentation, and then write a technical paper explaining things in a bit more detail than in your presentation. 

# Rubrics

## Final Presentation

The Final Presentation will be during our last day of class (May 6).

For the presentation, focus on the “Big Picture” ideas. That is, you should focus on providing **context** and **background/motivation** for your topic. This background can be historical, philosophical, mathematical, or it can just answer the question: why are we interested in this topic? That answer can vary depending on the topic: computer scientists are interested in graph algorithms for a very different reason than philosophers are interested in computable real numbers. So be sure to ground your topic in the broader area of research that it fits into (whether that is in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, philosophy of mathematics, or another area of research entirely). Try to find good, motivating examples of problems to go over in your short time here, which illustrate the main results / theorems / techniques of your topic.

The presentations will be graded on a 1-5 scale as follows:

1. No context given for this topic
2. Some context provided for the topic, without much motivation
3. Adequate context / motivation provided with minimal examples
4. Presenters explained the context for the topic, and provided strong motivating and/or historical examples
5. In addition to (4), presenters showed a deep understanding of why this topic is important in the context of some field of study.

## Final Paper

In your papers, you will get a chance to approach the topic in more depth. Your group should write an **expository paper** on your selected topic. The focus is pedagogical: to teach the reader (me) something new. Your paper should be thought of as an extension of the presentation: you should take the information you presented, and discuss it in more detail, depth, and/or otherwise cover it in a way that you weren't able to in the time constraints. Focus first on providing the necessary background/motivation, context, and a brief overview of the main results, definitions, theorems, algorithms, and/or proofs regarding your topic. That said, you should aim to provide some amount of depth on this paper.

Your group's paper will be graded on the following rubric (out of 10 points):

**2 points**: Grammar and tone. This is academic writing, use proper grammar and do not write in a "personal" or "familiar" style. You should cite your sources properly (I will not worry so much about the format of your citations, just that you actually cite things internally when you write them)

**4 points**: Background / motivation / context. See the rubric from the presentation above to get a good idea on how I'm grading this portion.

**3 points**: Clarity.

**1 point**: Depth. Try to explain a concept as deeply as you can.
