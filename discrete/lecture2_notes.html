<h1 id="counting-arrangements-and-functions">Counting, Arrangements and Functions</h1>
<p>We will revisit logic as we go through the semester. But discrete mathematics, itself, really is about <em>counting</em>. In other words: “discrete” objects are those which can be enumerated (one after the other), while “continuous” objects are things like the real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In how many ways can we arrange the letters C A T?</p>
<ul>
<li>CAT</li>
<li>CTA</li>
<li>ACT</li>
<li>ATC</li>
<li>TAC</li>
<li>TCA</li>
</ul>
<p>I count 6 ways.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is meant by an “arrangement” of the letters?</p>
<p>We will come back to this. For the rest of this lesson, we will work through some of the problems in <a href="http://bogart.openmathbooks.org/ctgd/what-is.html">Chapter 1, <em>Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="interlude-read-chapter-1-and-section-1.1">Interlude: Read Chapter 1 and Section 1.1</h2>
<p>Before proceeding, please make sure to read those parts. Now move on to <a href="http://bogart.openmathbooks.org/ctgd/s1-2-basics.html">Section 1.2, “Basic Counting Principles”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="problems-1---2">Problems 1 - 2</h2>
<p>Problem 2 is a generalization of Problem 1. Let’s work through Problem 1, you should work through Problem 2 on your own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five schools are going to send their baseball teams to a tournament, in which each team must play each other team exactly once. How many games are required?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li>How many games does team 1 have to play in? Team 1 plays teams 2 - 5, so that is 4 games.</li>
<li>How many games, other than with team 1, does team 2 have to play in? Team 2 plays teams 3 - 5, so that’s 3 games.</li>
<li>Let’s make a table to see how many games team <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> plays, besides the ones they played against teams <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(i - 1\)</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c | c}
i &amp; \text{Games} \\
\hline
1 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 2 \\
4 &amp; 1 \\
5 &amp; 0
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>So the answer to problem 1 is: <span class="math display">\[ \sum_{i = 1}^4 (5 -i) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\]</span></p>
<p>There is a trick to adding consecutive numbers in a row. ie, there is a trick for adding <span class="math inline">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n - 1)\)</span>. Play around with this problem in the case that <span class="math inline">\(n = 4, 5, 6, \ldots\)</span> and see if you can find the pattern.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-solution">Alternate Solution</h3>
<p>Suppose team <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is playing in a game. They have <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> possible opponents. And there are <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> different values for <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. So why isn’t the answer simply <span class="math inline">\(5 \times 4 = 20\)</span>? For a smaller example: if we had <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> teams, each team would play in <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> different gaems. So are there <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> games?</p>
<p>Let’s list out each of the two games that each team plays in:</p>
<p>Team 1’s games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team 1 vs Team 2</li>
<li>Team 1 vs Team 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Team 2’s games</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team 2 vs Team 1</strong></li>
<li>Team 2 vs Team 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Team 3’s games</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team 3 vs Team 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team 3 vs Team 2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What do we notice here? I bolded games that were already accounted for. In particular, every game shows up <em>twice</em>! That makes sense: there are two teams playing in each game.</p>
<p>In general, if there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> teams, each playing <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> other teams, then there are <strong>not</strong> <span class="math inline">\(n \times (n - 1)\)</span> games, because again, each game would appear twice if we listed out all <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> games for each team. So what is the correct formula?</p>

<li><span class="math inline">\(3 \times 5 = 15\)</span></li>
<li>There are <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> ordered pairs. This is exactly problem 3, where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the set of types of bread, and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the set of types of filling.</li>
<li>5 choices for drinks, 15 choices for sandwiches, and 4 choices for fruits makes <span class="math inline">\(5 \times 15 \times 4 = 300\)</span> choices.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<h2 id="problem-6">Problem 6</h2>
<p>There are two questions here: first, how many possible ice cream cones are there? This part allows for the choice of chocolate / chocolate / chocolate.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Check your answer:
</summary>
Since there are 12 choices for the top scoop, 12 for the second, and then 12 for the third, there are <span class="math inline">\(12^3 = 1728\)</span> possible ice cream cones.
</details>
<p>The second question asks: how many cones with three different flavors can be made? Once you’ve chosen one of the 12 flavors for the bottom scoop, how many choices do you have for the middle scoop? Then how many choices do you have for the top scoop?</p>
<details>
<summary>
Check your answer:
</summary>
There are <span class="math inline">\(12 \times 11 \times 10 = 1320\)</span> available cones with three different flavors of ice cream.
</details>
<h2 id="problem-7-functions">Problem 7: Functions</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li>There are two functions which map <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(f(1) = a, f(2) = b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(1) = a, g(2) = a\)</span>. Then there are two more which map <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Write those down. So there are <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> functions total.</li>
<li>Let’s think about this like in Problem 6. Pretend the set <span class="math inline">\(\{ a, b \}\)</span> refers to two different choices of ice cream flavors, and <span class="math inline">\(f(1), f(2)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f(3)\)</span> refer to the flavor choice picked for each scoop (top, middle, and bottom respectively). There are two choices for each scoop, so we have <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\)</span> functions total. See if you can write these down! (<strong>Note</strong>: Does this remind you of anything? How many rows in a truth table are there for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables, if each variable can only be assigned T or F?)</li>
<li>There are three choices for <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> and three for <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\)</span>, so there are <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> different functions total.</li>
<li>We’ve done this.</li>
<li>We’ve done this also! The “one to one” part is akin to saying, in problem 6, that we are not counting cones with two or more scoops of chocolate. Only cones with three different flavors are counted.</li>
<li>Try to summarize how the “function” and set-theoretic vocabulary generalizes the two questions in Problem 6.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="big-ideas">Big Ideas</h1>
<p>The problems we worked through help motivate a number of the counting concepts / rules we will deal with. The first is the <strong>multiplicative property</strong>: if we make two choices, with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> possible first choices, and, for each way of making that first choice, there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> possible second choices, then there are <span class="math inline">\(mn\)</span> way in which we can make the two choices.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem 3: There are 3 choices for the kind of bread, and 5 choices for the kind of filling.</li>
<li>Problem 5: This is a generalization of the multiplicative property, where we make three choices instead of two. But the principle is the same.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Exercise</strong>: How many arrangments of the letters “ABCD” are there?
<details>
<summary>
Hint: (click)
</summary>
An arrangement consists of choosing a first letter, then choosing a second one (that is different from the first), a third letter (different from the first two), and finally a fourth letter (different from the first three).
</details>
<h2 id="permutations">Permutations</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Given a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects <span class="math inline">\(a_1, \ldots, a_n\)</span>, a <em>permutation</em> of those objects is an arrangement of the objects in some order. A <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-<em>permutation</em> is an arrangement of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of those objects in some order.</p>
<p>For example, BACD is a permutation of the letters ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’, while BAD is a 3-permutation of those letters. Notice that a 4-permutation of those letters is just a permutation. In general, an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-permutation of a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects is just a permutation.</p>
<h2 id="factorials">Factorials</h2>
<p>If you have heard of factorials before, you likely have guessed that this concept would show up at some point in this lesson. The example at the beginning: “How many arrangements of the letters C A T are there?” highlighted this concept. There are three letters and <span class="math inline">\(3! = 6\)</span> arrangements of the letters.</p>
<p>Usually, <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span>, read “n factorial” is defined recursively as follows: <span class="math display">\[
n! = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
n \times (n-1)! &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 0
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>For example, <span class="math inline">\(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s flip the script, however. Instead of defining factorials this way as some arbitrary numerical operation, we define factorials combinatorially:</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: For a natural number <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span>, the <em>factorial</em> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, written <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span>, is equal to the number of arrangements of a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects.</p>
<p>Later on we will prove that <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> is equal to the previously given recursive formula. (This is strange in the case of <span class="math inline">\(n = 0\)</span>, as it’s not clear what an arrangement of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> objects is, but we will have to define things precisely first to make sense of it.)</p>
<h3 id="generalization-functions">Generalization: Functions</h3>
<p>Much of the discussion about permutations and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations can be discussed in the language of functions. I will assume that we know what a function is for now (later on, we will consider a more rigorous, set-theoretic definition of the term).</p>
<p><strong>Notation</strong>: If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are sets, then the notation “<span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span>” means “f is a function with domain <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and codomain <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>”. Recall: the <em>domain</em> of a function is the set of possible inputs to that function, and the <em>codomain</em> of a function is the set of possible outputs for that function.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A function <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span> is <em>one to one</em>, or <em>injective</em>, if whenever <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span> are different objects in the domain (<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>), then <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \neq f(y)\)</span> are different objects in the codomain.</p>
<p>This definition was given in <a href="#problem-7-functions">Problem 7</a>. In that problem, one was supposed to see that there is a correspondence between one to one functions and arrangements (or “<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations”, as I defined them).</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f : \{ 1, 2, \ldots, k \} \to \{ &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39; \}\)</span> is a one to one function. In what sense does <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> correspond to a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation of the letters ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’?</p>
<p>There are several good arguments one could give for this question. My hint would be to think about how we write down an actual <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(k = 2\)</span>, we need to write down 2 different letters. We pick a letter from ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, or ‘D’, and then we pick a different one. I think of it as literally writing down two blanks, and numbering the blanks as <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Now think about what <span class="math inline">\(f(1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(2)\)</span> are.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How many 3-permutations are there of a collection of 10 distinct objects?</p>
<p>In a similar vein to the above: write down three blanks, and now think about the number of choices for the first, second, and third blank.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How many 4-permutations are there of a collection of 10 distinct objects?</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Let <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a positive integer less than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Then the number of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations of a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects is equal to <span class="math display">\[
\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Show that your answers to the previous questions match up with this theorem.</p>
<p>This theorem is a generalization of the results we had been talking about in this section. But this is not necessarily the right way to think about counting <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutations: the simplest way is to just write down <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> blanks and count the number of choices for each blank.</p>
<h3 id="justification">Justification</h3>
<p>I stated the theorem without proving it. It’s worth thinking through the proof in terms of what these symbols mean.</p>
<p>As we know: <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> counts the number of permutations of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> objects. Let’s give an example: suppose our objects are the letters A, B, C, D, E. Then there are 120 (or <span class="math inline">\(5!\)</span>) permutations of those letters. If I wanted to list all of the 2-permutations of those letters, I could start by listing out all 120 permutations. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABCDE</li>
<li>ABCED</li>
<li>ABDCE</li>
<li>ABDEC</li>
<li>ABECD</li>
<li>ABEDC</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>After I have listed out all the permutations, I could delete the last three letters of each to get a 2-permutation. But of course, we end up with many repetitions: ABCDE, ABCED, ABDCE, ABDEC, ABECD, and ABEDC all give us the same 2-permutation: AB.</p>
<p>In fact, every 2-permutation will be repeated exactly 6 times! Why is that? Because <em>re-arranging the last three letters does not change the 2-permutation</em>! Why 6, though? Because there are exactly 6, or <span class="math inline">\(3!\)</span>, permutations of the last three objects.</p>
<p>So, out of those 120 permutations, we actually get 20 distinct 2-permutations, each of which repeats 6 times.</p>
<p>This argument is quite subtle and so it is worth thinking about more carefully. But the argument given does generalize. If we list out all the permutations of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> objects, and delete the last <span class="math inline">\((n - k)\)</span> letters, each <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation will repeat exactly <span class="math inline">\((n - k)!\)</span> times, because rearranging those last <span class="math inline">\(n - k\)</span> letters does not change the resulting <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-permutation.</p>
