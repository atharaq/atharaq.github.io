# Calculus I Lesson 8: Trig Derivatives

# Derivatives of sine and cosine

First watch this video, where I go through the derivatives of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$:

**Summary**:

* $(\sin(x))^\prime = \cos(x)$
* $(\cos(x))^\prime = -\sin(x)$

**Exercises**: Find the derivatives of the following functions, using the product rule and the trig derivatives above:

1. $y = x^2 \sin(x)$
2. $y = \cos(x)\sin(x)$
3. $y = (\cos(x))^2$. Recall that this is $\cos(x)\cos(x)$.

## Higher derivatives of sin and cosine

Notice the following: let $y = \sin(x)$

* $y^\prime = \cos(x)$
* $y^{\prime\prime} = -\sin(x)$
* $y^{\prime\prime\prime} = -\cos(x)$
* $y^{(4)} = \sin(x)$
* $y^{(5)} = \cos(x)$
* $y^{(6)} = -\sin(x)$

etc.

**Exercises**:

1. What is the 100th derivative of $\sin(x)$?
2. What is the 101st derivative of $\sin(x)$?
3. Explain the pattern of the derivatives of sin and cosine as best as you can.
4. Have you seen any other patterns like this before?

Now take a look at the following video:
