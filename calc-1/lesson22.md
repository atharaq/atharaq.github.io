The final exam for this course will be available on **Thursday, December 10** and due **Thursday, December 17** on Moodle. No late work will be accepted!

This semester, we covered the following:

* Limits and Continuity: [Chapter 2](https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/2-introduction)
* Derivatives: [Chapter 3](https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/3-introduction)
* Applications of Derivatives: [Chapter 4](https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-introduction)
* Integration: [Chapter 5](https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/5-introduction)

We can break this down further.

# Limits and Continuity

* Compute limits algebraically
* Compute limits using the squeeze theorem
* Compute limits using l'Hopital's rule
* Determine continuity at a point
* Make a function continuous at a point

# Derivatives

* Compute derivatives of algebraic functions using the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.
* Know the derivatives of trig, exponential, and logarithmic functions.
* Know how to find derivatives of inverse trig functions using implicit differentiation.
* Recognize graphs of functions and their derivatives.
* Graph the derivative of a function.
* Determine if a function is differentiable at a point.

# Applications of Derivatives

* Related Rates problems
* Find the linear approximation of a function
* Given a differentiable function, determine its maxima, minima, points of inflection, intervals where it is increasing, decreasing, concave up / down
* Use the Mean Value Theorem to prove facts about derivatives
* Optimization Problems (find the maximum area given a perimeter, find the shortest path in a run/swim problem, etc)
* Putting derivatives (and second derivatives) in context: analyzing graphs of real-world data (ie incarceration rates / climate change / other current events data).

# Integration

* Find general antiderivatives of functions
* Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: derivatives of definite integrals
* Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 2: evaluating definite integrals using antiderivatives
* Integration by Substitution
* Applications: Work / Force and Velocity / Position (not covered on Exam 3)
