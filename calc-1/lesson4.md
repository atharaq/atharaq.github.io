# Calculus I Lesson 4

Last time we discussed two ways of computing limits: direct substitution and algebraic manipulation. We ended by discussing an example which could not be studied using these methods: $\sin(\frac{1}{x})$. Let's continue this example.

# Limit of $\sin(\frac{1}{x})$ (15)

This section is meant to be read alongside [Example 2.7](https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/2-2-the-limit-of-a-function#fs-id1170572342287) from the textbook. The problem is to compute ${\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}} \sin(\frac{1}{x})$. To see what happens as $x \rightarrow 0$, the textbook computes values of $x$ that are getting smaller and smaller (closer to 0). The table shows that the $y$-values do not seem to converge to one, single real number as we make $x$ smaller and smaller.

The textbook then goes through another line of reasoning to show that we can pick specific points where we can calculate the $y$-values directly. Let's look at the unit circle:
