## Course Description

**Prerequisite**: Calculus (I, II, or III)  
Covers a variety of topics that provide a foundation for both higher mathematics and computer science. These topics may include logic and formal proofs, set theory, number theory, probability, mathematical induction, algorithms, recurrence relations, equivalence relations and partial orderings, and topics in graph theory (including isomorphism, traversability, planarity, and colorings).

## Learning Outcomes

In parentheses below, you can see how the course learning outcomes map to the [Mathematics / CS Program Learning Outcomes](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/about-the-program/program-learning-outcomes/).

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to...

* Understand the basic structures of higher mathematics, including sets, functions, relations, equivalence relations, partial orders, trees, and graphs (PLO 1)
* Apply counting principles, including those using the multiplicative property, factorials, and binomial coefficients (PLO 1, 2)
* Apply the basic results of mathematical logic to analyze the forms of rigorous arguments and construct their own, rigorous arguments (PLO 1, 3)
* Convert between different numerical bases (PLO 1, 2)
* Apply various proof techniques, including induction, contradiction, and direct proof, to analyze and construct arguments regarding mathematical structures, counting principles, and properties of numbers (PLO 3, 5)
* Typeset mathematical documents using LaTeX (PLO 3)

## Required Textbooks

We will be using two free online textbooks this semester:

* [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html) 3rd Edition (Oscar Levin)
* [Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery](http://bogart.openmathbooks.org/) (Kenneth Bogart)

In addition, lecture notes will be posted on the course website (and linked to on Moodle)

## Required Software

You will be required to use the LaTeX typesetting system to type your homework assignments. Details and instructions will be provided on the first lesson. You have the option of either creating a free account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com?r=c1af9661&rm=d&rs=b), or downloading a LaTeX distribution and editor on your personal computer / laptop.

## Grading Rubric

* 30%: Problem Sets (5-7 problem sets)
* 10%: Exit Tickets
* 20% (10% x 2): Mid-semester Exams (possibly take-home)
* 20%: Final Exam (possibly take home)
* 10%: Problem Presentations (in-class)
* 10%: Final Project
  * 5% Presentation
  * 5% Paper

## Attendance

I understand that there may be times you miss a class due to emergencies, illnesses, and other reasons. For this reason, I post the lecture notes online and on Moodle. If you miss a class, be sure to submit any work that was due that day, find out what work you missed, and catch yourself up. You can use my office hours or work with others in class to help catch yourself up.

## Late Homework Policy

Mathematics is extremely cumulative, and so it is important to stay on top of your work when it is assigned. If you miss a class or fall behind, you still need to stay on top of the work that was covered. Do your best to stay current with the work, using all the resources at your disposal to help you.

If, due to emergencies or illnesses, you require some flexibility, you can reach out to me and we can discuss what you can do to make things up. However, if you fall behind on work and submit work late, I will have less time to actually look at it, grade it and provide meaningful feedback. If work is submitted too late, I reserve the right to simply give it a zero and move on if I do not have time to look at it.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments with other students. All individual assignments must be completed on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy: https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity

## Office of Disabilities

It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035, [odr@purchase.edu](mailto:odr@purchase.edu).

## Tutoring

Tutoring is available in the Einstein Corner, located in the Natural Sciences Building room 3046. Note: this is an upper-level elective, and so they likely do not have a tutor who has taken this course. I suggest forming study groups with each other, and coming to office hours regularly.

## COMMUNITY HEALTH DURING COVID-19:

To ensure that each of us has a healthy and safe learning experience, all students are required to remain informed and follow Purchase College Policy and/or any departmental, local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations for attending classes on campus and in a remote learning environment.

Within courses that involve in-person contact, all students, faculty members, staff, and visitors are required to adhere to the expectations outlined on the [College’s COVID-19 website](https://www.purchase.edu/covid-19-updates-and-plans/). Failure to comply with requirements (e.g. wearing masks, maintaining social distancing where applicable) will result in the request to leave the classroom for that in-person class session. Students may also be referred to the [Office of Community Standards](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/community-standards/).

Do not enter campus buildings if you test positive for or are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. Contact your faculty and [Health Services](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/health-services/index.php) if you need to miss class because of COVID-19 symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test result. The conservatory/school will address on a case by case basis student absences due to COVID-19, while awaiting test results, or during quarantine.

## Wellness and Mental Health

Purchase College has many resources to support our students' wellness and mental health. Please take a look at the [Health and Wellness website](https://www.purchase.edu/campus-life/health-and-wellness/) for more information. In particular, check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
