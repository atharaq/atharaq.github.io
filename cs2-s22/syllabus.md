## Course Description

**Prerequisite**: Computer Science I  
This course provides a continuation of Computer Science I. The course emphasizes programming as a basis for the study of computers. While programming is the main focus, the course will afford us the opportunity to introduce other concepts central to the field including data representation, object-oriented design, algorithms, recursion, Boolean logic and some data structures. We will be studying the Java programming language.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to...

* Understand basic features Java syntax and object-oriented programming including: (PLO 1)
  * variables
  * conditionals
  * loops
  * Strings and arrays
  * methods
  * classes
  * polymorphism
  * inheritence
  * encapsulation
* Design complex programs using some of the basic Java syntax to solve problems algorithmically (PLO 1, 2)
* Read code snippets and determine what problem they are solving, as well as how the code solves said problem (PLO 1, 3, 5)
* Use modular design and object-oriented concepts to create clean solutions to large problems (1, 2, 3)
* Design algorithmic solutions to problems and analyze their efficiency (PLO 1, 5)

## Required Textbook

Think Java (2nd edition) by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield.  
* [Free PDF](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/)
* [Interactive version with a compiler](https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava2/) (**strongly recommended**)

## Java / IntelliJ

All programming assignments will be completed in Java. You will need:
1. Download and install [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
2. Download and install the Ultimate Edition of the [Jetbrains IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and [apply for a free full license](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) using your Purchase email address.

## Replit

We will be using [Replit](https://replit.com/) for sharing live code / in class exercises, homework assignments, and submitting projects. Sign up information is available on Moodle.

## Discord Server

Last year, students found that using a Discord server to chat remotely about projects and the coursework was very helpful. I encourage you all to join our Discord server this year. Solomon and I will monitor the chat from time to time to help answer questions, but you all should join so you can work with each other!

The link to the Discord server will be available on Moodle.

## Attendance

My expectation is that students come to class as much as possible. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic, I understand when this may be difficult or outright impossible (see the next section on community health). In particular, please do stay home if you feel sick at all. I will do my best to make sure notes, readings, and other materials are available online for those who need them.

That said, please do come to class as much as you can. This will allow me to see how well students understand material, and you to work through problems and questions with each other (and me).

## Community Health During COVID-19

To ensure that each of us has a healthy and safe learning experience, all students are required to remain informed and follow Purchase College Policy and/or any departmental, local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations for attending classes on campus and in a remote learning environment.

Within courses that involve in-person contact, all students, faculty members, staff, and visitors are required to adhere to the expectations outlined on the [College’s COVID-19 website](https://www.purchase.edu/covid-19-updates-and-plans/). Failure to comply with requirements (e.g. wearing masks, maintaining social distancing where applicable) will result in the request to leave the classroom for that in-person class session. Students may also be referred to the [Office of Community Standards](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/community-standards/).

Do not enter campus buildings if you test positive for or are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. Contact your faculty and [Health Services](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/health-services/index.php) if you need to miss class because of COVID-19 symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test result. The conservatory/school will address on a case by case basis student absences due to COVID-19, while awaiting test results, or during quarantine.

## Grading Policy

* 40%: 4 programming assignments (10% each)
* 10%: Homework, class exercises, and class participation
* 10%: Presentations (2 or 3 short code demos / algorithm explanations)
* 25%: Quizzes. (5 quizzes, roughly 45 minutes each)
* 15%: Final Exam (Thursday, **May 19**)

## Late Homework Policy

Programming projects may require a lot of time and I plan to give you plenty of time to complete them (at least 2 weeks). However, things do happen, and so I will make an allowance of up to **48 hours of grace time** for you to use among all the projects. (That is, if your first project is 48 hours late, then the rest of your projects need to be handed in on time.)

This policy does **not** apply to the weekly homework and class exercises, which must be submitted on time.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and projects with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per [Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity)

## Office of Disabilities

It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035, odr@purchase.edu.

## Tutoring

Tutoring is available from the Einstein Corner. Students can make appointments via the Starfish platform. [More information here.](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/)

## Mental Health

I understand that this is a challenging and stressful time. Please check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/index.php) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
