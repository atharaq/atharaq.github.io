# Warm-up

As a warm-up for this lesson, try out the following exercise. Try this on your own, and then watch the video where I go through this exercise.

Write a program which asks the user to input the size of a list. Then ask the user to input an integer for each element of the list, and output the minimum element of the list.

Input and output should look like the following:

> How large a list do you want?  
>   4  
> Enter in element 0:  
>   15  
> Enter in element 1:
>   -2  
> Enter in element 2:  
>   2  
> Enter in element 3:  
>   1  
> The minimum element in this list is -2.

# Methods (Chapter 4)

You may have needed to skim [Chapter 4](...) on methods, but now is a good time to go back and read through that properly. As always, make sure to do all the exercises you can.

# Strings (Chapter 6)

By this point, you should have already have read [Chapter 6](...) on strings. I wanted to point out a couple of short points about Strings in Java.
