**Instructor**: Professor Abdul-Quader (or just "Athar")  
**Email**: athar.abdulquader AT purchase DOT edu  
**Office Hours** via Zoom (link on Moodle): Thursdays TBA  
**Learning Assistant**: Solomon Falls (solomon.falls AT purchase DOT edu)  
Solomon will post his office hours on Moodle  
**Course Format**: Online combined (synchronous and asynchronous)  
**Meeting Times**: Mondays, 10:30 - 12:10

**Note on the format**: the course is held in an **online combined** format. We will meet once a week, and I will post asynchronous content for the rest of the week.
Make sure you are coming to our weekly meetings having done the asynchronous work and are ready to share your ideas and code with each other!

## Disclaimer

Due to the nature of this semester, please note that the syllabus is subject to change. Any changes to the syllabus will be announced either in class or via an announcement posted to Moodle and emailed to the class.

## Course Description

**Prerequisite**: Computer Science I
This course provides a continuation of Computer Science I. The course emphasizes programming as a basis for the study of computers. While programming is the main focus, the course will afford us the opportunity to introduce other concepts central to the field including data representation, object-oriented design, algorithms, recursion, Boolean logic and some data structures. We will be studying the Java programming language.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to...

* Understand the basics of basic Java syntax and object-oriented programming including:
  * variables 
  * conditionals
  * loops
  * Strings and arrays
  * methods
  * classes
  * polymorphism
  * inheritence
  * encapsulation
* Design complex programs using some of the basic Java syntax to solve problems algorithmically
* Read code snippets and determine what problem they are solving, as well as how the code solves said problem 
* Use modular design and object-oriented concepts to create clean solutions to large problems
* Design algorithmic solutions to problems and analyze their efficiency

## Required Textbook

Think Java (2nd edition) by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield.  
* [Free PDF](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/)
* [Interactive version with a compiler](https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava2/) (**strongly recommended**)

## Java / IntelliJ

All programming assignments will be completed in Java. You will need:
1. Download and install [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
2. Download and install the Ultimate Edition of the [Jetbrains IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and [apply for a free full license](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) using your Purchase email address.

## Discord Server

Last year, students found that using a DIscord server to chat remotely about projects and the coursework was very helpful. I encourage you all to join our Discord server this year. Solomon and I will monitor the chat from time to time to help answer questions, but you all should join so you can work with each other!

## Attendance

Attendance at all classes is required. You are allowed **three** absences. After that an absence for any reason will be counted against you. Two tardiness instances will be counted as one absence. You are responsible for all material and all assignments on classes that you miss.

## Grading Policy

* 40%: 4 programming assignments (10% each)
* 15%: Homework, quizzes, class exercises, and class participation
* 10%: Presentations (3-5 short code demos / algorithm explanations)
* 20%: 2 mid-semester exams (tentatively scheduled: March 1 and April 1). Open book, open notes.
* 15%: Final Exam (take home, open book, open notes)
