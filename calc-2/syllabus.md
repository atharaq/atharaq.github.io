MAT 1510

4 credits  
Spring 2021

**Instructor**: Professor Abdul-Quader (or just "Athar")  
**Email**: athar.abdulquader AT purchase DOT edu  
**Office Hours** via Zoom (link on Moodle): Tuesdays 12 - 1:30, Fridays 10:30 - 12
**Learning Assistant**: Orion Watler (orion.watler AT purchase DOT edu)  
Orion will post his office hours on Moodle  
**Course Format**: Online combined (synchronous and asynchronous)  
**Meeting Times**: Thursdays, 12:30 - 2:10

**Note on the format**: the course is held in an **online combined** format. We will meet once a week, and I will post asynchronous content for the rest of the week.
Make sure you are coming to our weekly meetings having done the asynchronous work and are ready to share your ideas and code with each other!

## Disclaimer

Due to the nature of this semester, please note that the syllabus is subject to change. Any changes to the syllabus will be announced either in class or via an announcement posted to Moodle and emailed to the class.

## Course Description

**Prerequisite: Calculus I**  
A continuation of MAT 1500. Topics include differentiation and integration of logarithmic, exponential, and inverse trigonometric functions; techniques of integration; arc length; infinite series; and improper integrals. Applications include work, growth, and decay problems and volumes of solids of revolution.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to...

* Use basic derivative facts to compute antiderivatives and definite integrals
* Comptue definite and indefinite integrals by choosing appropriate integration techniques
* Solve problems in a range of applications using integration, including:
  * Acceleration problems
  * Finding centroids of regions
  * Areas between curves
  * Volumes of solids of revolution
  * Arc Lengths of curves defined by functions
* Model 2-dimensional motion using parametric equations and polar coordinates
* Calculate areas and arc lengths of curves given by parametric equations
* Use convergence tests to determine if an infinite series sums to a finite quantity
* Use Taylor series to approximate transcendental functions by polynomials

## Required Textbook

[*Calculus Volume 2* by Edwin Herman and Gilbert Strang](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2)

## Required Software

For written homework assignments, students will need to use either a scanner app or a scanner to create a single PDF of all of their work and upload the work to Moodle. There are several good scanner apps available for Android and iOS devices:
* Scannable (iOS)
* Genius Scan (Android / iOS)
* CamScanner (Android / iOS)

### Zoom

We will be using Zoom for our synchronous lessons, as well as office hours and meetings. You may need to download it the first time we use it.

### MyOpenMath Online Homework

We will be using the [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com) website for online homework. Please register ASAP using the Course ID and Enrollment Key provided on **Moodle**. Make sure to use your name and Purchase College email address.

### Discord Server

In some of my other courses, students found that using a DIscord server to chat remotely about homework assignments and lectures was very helpful. I encourage you all to join our Discord server this year. Orion and I will monitor the chat from time to time to help answer questions, but you all should join so you can work with each other!

## Calculator Policy

A graphing calculator is required for this course. You are welcome to use online calculators like [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com). If you would like an actual calculator, I recommend getting a TI-83+ or TI-84+. Unless otherwise specified, calculators are allowed for all assignments, including exams and quizzes.

## Attendance

Attendance at all classes is required. You are allowed **three** absences. After that an absence for any reason will be counted against you. Two tardiness instances will be counted as one absence. You are responsible for all material and all assignments on classes that you miss.

## Grading Policy

* 30% Written Homeworks (8-10 assignments), quizzes, and class participation
   * **Note**: This includes *completion of asynchronous activities*!
* 20% Online homework
* 20% Problem Presentations (4-6 **short** explanations of a homework / exam / other challenging problem)
* 15% Mid-semester exams (3 exams during the semester, all open-book / notes / untimed)
* 15% Final Exam (open-book / notes / untimed)

## Late Homework Policy

Being absent the day that homework is assigned, or the day that it is due, is not an excuse for being late with your homework. If you miss a class, you are expected to email any work that is due that day. I reserve the right to not accept homework assignments late, or to penalize such submissions. In the past, I have given a 50% penalty for late homework assignments.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and projects with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per [Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity).

## Office of Disabilities

The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251- 6035, odr@purchase.edu

## Tutoring

Tutoring is available virtually from the Einstein Corner. Students can make appointments via the Starfish platform. [More information here.](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/)

## Mental Health

I understand that this is a challenging and stressful time. Please check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/index.php) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
