Welcome to Calculus 2! Please watch my welcome video above, where I go over the course expectations, grading rubric, and other "first day" housekeeping information. [You can find my slides here.](lec0.html)

# Desmos Activity

Next, I'd like you to complete this [Desmos activity](https://student.desmos.com/join/m7afjt). I'm hopeful that this will help you understand an important application of calculus: helping us make sense of numbers in the first place!

# Prerequisite material

I expect that most of you have learned about integrals already in Calculus I. Indeed, I covered integration in [lessons 18-21](https://atharaq.github.io/calc-1/) of my Calc I course last semester. You are free to look at those notes and videos if you ever need a refresher. Of course, I'm sure that there are some things that students may have forgotten in the meantime. Coming in, I expect you to know the following:

* The geometric meaning and the limit definition of the "definite integral".
* The relationship between derivatives and definite integrals (the "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus").
* How to use simple derivative facts to evaluate definite integrals
  * For example: since $\frac{d}{dx} (\sin(x)) = \cos(x)$, we can compute $\int\limits_0^\pi \cos(x) dx$ as $\sin(\pi) - \sin(0)$, which is just $0$.
* Some basic antiderivative facts:
  * An antiderivative of $x$ is $\frac{x^2}{2}$.
  * An antiderivative of $x^2$ is $\frac{x^3}{3}$.
  * The reverse power rule in general: an antiderivative of $x^n$ (x raised to any power) is $\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$. Increase the power by one and then divide by it!
  * An antiderivative of $\frac{1}{x}$ is $\ln\|x\|$, since the derivative of $\ln\|x\|$ is $\frac{1}{x}$.
  * [Many more in our textbook!](https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/a-table-of-integrals)

Ideally, you would also have been introduced to the technique of **integration by substitution**. I know that this is not always covered in every Calculus I course, and so I will talk a bit about it on Thursday.

## Resources

If you need a refresher on any of the information above, there are many resources that work well:

* [Chapter 1 of our textbook](https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-2/pages/1-introduction) covers all of this, from sections 1.1 to 1.4 (and 1.5 is on substitution).
* [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/IntegralsIntro.aspx) for Calculus I includes this information as well. This is one of my favorite resources on the internet!
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-2) has many materials reviewing these as well.

# Written Homework

Your first assignment is due on Moodle **before class on Thursday**:

1. We saw, in class, that there are sequences of rational numbers whose limit is not rational. Is there a sequence of integers whose limit is not an integer? Explain why or why not.
2. Give an explanation, in English, of the meaning of a derivative of a function. (You may use graphs or pictures to supplement your explanation. Feel free to use [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) to make graphs if you need them.)
3. Give an explanation, in English, of the meaning of the definite integral of a function. (You may use graphs or pictures to supplement your explanation.)
4. Suppose f(x) is an odd function: that means, for every x, $f(-x) = -f(x)$. (For example, look at the [graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cnledtgpoq) of $f(x) = \sin(x)$). Explain why, for any real number a, $\int\limits_{-a}^a f(x) dx = 0$. Again, you may use pictures/graphs to supplement your explanation.

# MyOpenMath Homework

There is also an assignment on MyOpenMath. This is a website we will be using for online homework this semester. Check on Moodle for the link and login information. Get started soon, so that if you have trouble on any of these problems, we can discuss it on Thursday!
