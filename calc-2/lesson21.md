Last time we discussed the [ratio test](https://atharaq.github.io/calc-2/lesson20.html#/ratio). Recall: given a series $\sum a_n$, we look at the limits of the ratios $\|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\|$. If this limit is less than $1$, then the series converges absolutely. If it's greater than $1$, the series diverges. If it is equal to $1$, then the series converges conditionally. Here we go through two examples of using the ratio test to check for convergence of a series.
