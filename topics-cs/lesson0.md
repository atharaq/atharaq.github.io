# Incomplete map of CS

After the "fundamentals", computer science research can be in any of a number of topics. The below are very incomplete, but give an idea of how things might break down. These categories are not rigid: research in one of these areas may affect all the other categories, for example.

## Foundations

* Computability
* Complexity
* Analysis of algorithms
* Graph theory
* Learning theory
* Logic
* ...

## Software systems

* Programming Languages
* Compilers
* Operating Systems
* Networks
* Databases
* ...

## Intelligent Systems

* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
* Natural Language Processing
* Computer Vision

## Application Development

* Graphics
* UI Design
* Software architecture
* ...

## Computer Engineering

* Computer architecture
* Digital Logic
* ...

All of these assume the basic fundamentals: programming, algorithms, the basics of running time and Big Oh analysis, data structures, etc. As mentioned before, these are all interconnected. This is incomplete, but it's a decent approximation. You can, for example, see some of the "tracks" available in the [Columbia University CS curriculum](https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/c/d.php?d=271) or the [Cornell University CS curriculum](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/csmajor/electivesCS).

# This course

* Interleaved lectures (by me) and student Presentations
* 3 presentations per student (roughly 15-20 minutes per student)
* 2 short papers (2-5 pages and 5-8 pages)

## Lecture portion

* **Complexity theory**.
* Entirely mathematics based, but studying computer science problems / algorithms
* Won't cover everything, but get a broad introduction to the topic and major research trends.

## Student presentations and papers

Pick **any** CS topic. We've seen the possible list above and [on the syllabus](syllabus.html), but there are many other things that one can talk about.

* Talks and papers should be **pedagogical**. We should learn from them. Give us a glimpse of what that field or topic is about, why it's important, etc.
* Let me know what topic you are interested in via email by **Friday, September 9**. If you have no idea, come to office hours this week or schedule a Zoom call with me next week.
* Come to office hours **at least one week** before your talks! That will give me time to evaluate whether you have the appropriate resources for the talk, and to suggest other resources if you need them.

**Note for the seniors**: your research topic here may overlap with your senior project, but the focus is different. Here, we are not focusing on producing original work, but on learning and teaching something deeply. For example, if you are working on an idea about quantum computing, your senior project might be a new quantum algorithm, while your papers / talks here might focus on "What is quantum computing?" from a big picture perspective.

## Tentative schedule for workload:

* Pick a topic: weeks 1-2
* Problem set 1: week 2-3
* Presentation 1: weeks 5-6
* Problem set 2: weeks 7-8
* Presentation 2: weeks 8-9
* Midterm paper: week 10
* Problem set 3: weeks 11-12
* Presentation 3: last week of the semester
* Problem set 4: last week of the semester
* Final paper: due during finals week

# Complexity theory

1. What is an algorithm?
2. How do we understand the "running time" of an algorithm?
3. What is the difference between an algorithm and its various implementations?
4. Suppose we have an algorithm to solve a problem. Does its efficiency depend on the hardware that we run on? Should it?
