# Data Structures

MAT 3710

4 credits  
Spring 2021

**Instructor**: Professor Abdul-Quader (or just "Athar")  
**Email**: athar.abdulquader AT purchase DOT edu  
**Office Hours** via Zoom (link on Moodle): Tuesdays 12 - 1:30, Fridays 10:30 - 12
**Course Format**: Online combined (synchronous and asynchronous)  
**Meeting Times**: Mondays, 2:30 - 4:10

**Note on the format**: the course is held in an **online combined** format. We will meet once a week, and I will post asynchronous content for the rest of the week.
Make sure you are coming to our weekly meetings having done the asynchronous work and are ready to share your ideas and code with each other!

## Disclaimer

Due to the nature of this semester, please note that the syllabus is subject to change. Any changes to the syllabus will be announced either in class or via an announcement posted to Moodle and emailed to the class.

## Course Description

**Prerequisite**: Computer Science II  
Covers standard data structures (e.g., lists, stacks, heaps) and object¬-oriented algorithms important to software development. Tradeoffs between time and space are examined. Includes programming as well as theoretical assignments. Examples are often taken from technical interview-style questions.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to...

* Implement core data structures in the Java programming language, including:
  * stacks
  * queues
  * trees
  * heaps
  * hashtables
  * graphs
* Analyze the running times of the operations of each of these data structures using Big Oh notation
* Design optimal algorithmic solutions to problems, using knowledge of these data structures and their running times
* Evaluate algorithms, looking for possible inefficiencies

## Required Textbook

Clifford Shaffer, [Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, 3rd edition](https://people.cs.vt.edu/shaffer/Book/JAVA3elatest.pdf). This text is available for free online.

We will be using parts of the [OpenDSA CS3 textbook](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/CS3/html/) as well.

## Java / IntelliJ

All programming assignments will be completed in Java. You will need:
1. Download and install [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
2. Download and install the Ultimate Edition of the [Jetbrains IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and [apply for a free full license](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) using your Purchase email address.

## CodingRooms

We will be using [CodingRooms](https://codingrooms.com/) for sharing live code / in class exercises. Sign up information is available on Moodle.

## Discord Server

I encourage you all to join our Discord server this year. I will monitor the chat from time to time to help answer questions, but you all should join so you can work with each other!

Sign up information will be available on Moodle.

## Attendance

Attendance at all classes is required. You are allowed **three** absences. After that an absence for any reason will be counted against you. Two tardiness instances will be counted as one absence. You are responsible for all material and all assignments on classes that you miss.

## Grading Policy

* 30%: Programming Projects
* 20%: Written Homework Assignments (4-5 assignments)
* 10%: Quizzes, class exercises, and class participation
* 20%: Presentations (4-5 challenging problems sprinkled through the semester)
* 20%: Final Project.

## Late Homework Policy

Programming projects may require a lot of time and I plan to give you plenty of time to complete them (at least 2 weeks). However, things do happen, and so I will make an allowance of up to **48 hours of grace time** for you to use among all the projects. (That is, if your first project is 48 hours late, then the rest of your projects need to be handed in on time.)

This policy does **not** apply to the weekly homework and class exercises, which must be submitted on time.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and projects with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per [Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity)

## Office of Disabilities

The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251- 6035, odr@purchase.edu

## Mental Health

I understand that this is a challenging and stressful time. Please check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/index.php) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
