> To miss out on mathematics is to live without an opportunity to play with beautiful ideas and see the world in a new light. To grasp mathematical beauty is a unique and sublime experience that everyone should demand. All of us—no matter who you are or where you’re from—can cultivate mathematical affection.

# Introduction

Welcome to Calculus I! Before we start let's go through some administrative notes:

## Office hours

Mondays and Thursdays, 9:30 AM
* Don't feel like you're on your own in this class.
* Be in touch with me often

## Studying / workload

* 4 credits: 4 hours in class, 8 hours out of class (individual studying, homework, etc)
* Lecture videos, reading notes, textbook all help, **but most importantly**: do lots of practice problems.

## Study groups

* Having a social structure around you helps you stay on task and stay motivated
* Form study groups with other students in the class
  * Quiz each other about lectures / notes
  * Keep each other on track
  * Share work on exercises
  * Help each other with homework
* (Exams should be taken individually, of course!)

## Grading

The syllabus, posted on Moodle, lists out the grading scheme. Pay attention to this breakdown: there will be many different forms of assessing your work:

* Homework and quizzes (40%) 40% Homework and quizzes
* Classwork / participation / group work (10%)
* Exams: 3 x 5%, plus final exam (10%)
* Problem presentation (2 x 5%)
* Final paper (15%)

# Functions

Function: A relationship between two variables, denoted $x$ and $y$, where different $y$-values cannot be related to the same $x$-value

$$f : X \to Y$$ is read "f is a function with domain $X$ and codomain $Y$". In Calc 1 - 2: usually sets of **real numbers** (usually intervals).

## Describing Functions

How do we describe functions? (At least 4 ways):

1. Algebraically: with an equation / algebraic expression
2. Visually: with a graph
3. Numerically: with a table
4. Verbally: "the function which divides its input by 2 and then squares the result"

Other ways?

## Side Note

Most functions **cannot** be described efficiently.

...but it's usually easier if we do have some formula.

Q: What do scientists / engineers do with real data sets?

# Classes of Functions

Exercise: Come up with examples of the following:

1. A function which is "bounded above" (its graph does not keep going "up" to positive $\infty$)
2. A function which is "bounded below" (its graph does not keep going "down" to negative $\infty$)
3. A function which is neither bounded above nor below
4. A function with a "hole"
5. A function with an "asymptote"

## Bounded above

$y = 4 - x^2$

</div>

## Bounded Below

$y = x^4$

## Neither

$y = x^3 - x$

</div>

## "Hole"

$y = \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$

## Asymptote

$y = \frac{x^2+1}{x-1}$

# Classes of Functions

The functions we have seen were all either **polynomials** or **rational functions**.

* Polynomials: sums of functions of the form $a x^n$ ($a$ is a constant real, $n$ a non-negative integer)
* Rational functions: quotients of polynomials

They give us good examples of "well-behaved" functions (functions whose behavior follows certain rules).

## Behavior examples

* if the **degree** of a polynomial is even, it will either be bounded above or below. (Determined by *leading coefficient*)
* if the degree of a polynomial is odd, it will be unbounded above and below
* a rational function has an asymptote if ...
* a rational function has a hole if ...

# Other Behaviors?

* $y = \sin(x)$
* $y = e^x$
* $y = \arctan(x)$

# Homework

* DeltaMath: create your account, first homework is already posted
* Moodle: short responses + video
