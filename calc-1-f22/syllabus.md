## Required Textbook

[*Calculus Volume 1* by Edwin Herman and Gilbert Strang](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1)

## Required Software

For written homework assignments, students will need to use either a scanner app or a scanner to create a single PDF of all of their work and upload the work to Moodle. There are several good scanner apps available for Android and iOS devices:
* Scannable (iOS)
* Genius Scan (Android / iOS)
* CamScanner (Android / iOS)

## Calculator Policy

A graphing calculator is required for this course. You are welcome to use online calculators like [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com). If you would like an actual calculator, I recommend getting a TI-83+ or TI-84+. Unless otherwise specified, calculators are allowed for all assignments, including exams and quizzes.

## Attendance

Attendance at all classes is required. You are allowed **three** absences. After that an absence for any reason will be counted against you. Two tardiness instances will be counted as one absence. You are responsible for all material and all assignments on classes that you miss.

## Grading Policy

update

* 30% Written Homeworks (8-10 assignments), quizzes, and class participation
   * **Note**: This includes *completion of asynchronous activities*!
* 20% Online homework
* 20% Problem Presentations (4-6 **short** explanations of a homework / exam / other challenging problem)
* 15% Mid-semester exams (3 exams during the semester, all open-book / notes / untimed)
* 15% Final Exam (open-book / notes / untimed)

## Late Homework Policy

Being absent the day that homework is assigned, or the day that it is due, is not an excuse for being late with your homework. If you miss a class, you are expected to email any work that is due that day. I reserve the right to not accept homework assignments late, or to penalize such submissions. In the past, I have given a 50% penalty for late homework assignments.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and projects with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per [Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity).

## Office of Disabilities

The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251- 6035, odr@purchase.edu

## Tutoring

Tutoring is available virtually from the Einstein Corner. Students can make appointments via the Starfish platform. [More information here.](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/)

## Mental Health

I understand that this is a challenging and stressful time. Please check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/index.php) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
