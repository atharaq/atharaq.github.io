## Course Description

**Prerequisite​**: Precalculus
The basic concepts of the differential and integral calculus. Focus is on the applicability of these topics to an array of problems. The first course in a three-semester series.

## Learning Outcomes

In parentheses below, you can see how the course learning outcomes map to the [Mathematics / CS Program Learning Outcomes](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/about-the-program/program-learning-outcomes/).

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to…

* Understand the concept of a function, and how functions are used to relate quantitative variables (PLO 1, 2)
* Describe functions visually, verbally, algebraically, and numerically (PLO 1, 2)
* Find the limit of a function algebraically and graphically (PLO 2)
* Compute derivatives using several methods (PLO 2)
* Apply techniques of differential calculus to solve problems in several domains (PLO 1, 2)
* Learn the relationship between antiderivatives and definite integrals (PLO 2)
* Explain the importance of calculus in examining topics in current events or historical developments in mathematics (PLO 3, 4, 5)

This course also fulfills the **Core: Mathematics** general education requirements, whose learning outcomes are listed on the [Core Curriculum Learning Outcomes website](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/provost/undergraduate-core-curriculum/student-learning-outcomes/)

## Required Textbook

[*Calculus Volume 1* by Edwin Herman and Gilbert Strang](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1). This textbook is available for free online.

Students who desire additional resources can look into other textbooks, but none of these are required:
* Stewart, *​Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals ​(2nd edition)*. This is a standard (but pricey) textbook for introductory calculus
* Spivak, *​Calculus​ (4th edition)*. This book is for students who are more interested in the rigorous mathematical underpinnings of calculus. This book emphasizes proofs over applications. If you are interested in higher mathematics, this might be worth looking into!
* Courant and John, *​Introduction to Calculus and Analysis I​*. An alternative to the Spivak book, it also is good for students who are interested in higher math.

## Required Software

For written homework assignments, students will need to use either a scanner app or a scanner to create a single PDF of all of their work and upload the work to Moodle. There are several good scanner apps available for Android and iOS devices:
* Scannable (iOS)
* Genius Scan (Android / iOS)
* CamScanner (Android / iOS)

### DeltaMath Online Homework

We will be using the free website **​DeltaMath​** for online homework. To access this software, you can [create a free student account using this link](https://www.deltamath.com/students?code=VZ3Z-2MV9). If the above link does not work, use the following steps:

1. Go to [​www.deltamath.com](https://www.deltamath.com)
2. Click “For students" and then "Register".
3. Enter Teacher Code ​**357935​**.
4. Select MAT 1500 Fall 2022 for “Class” and register using your **purchase.edu** email address please!

## Calculator Policy

A graphing calculator is required for this course. You are welcome to use online calculators like [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com). If you would like an actual calculator, I recommend getting a TI-83+ or TI-84+. Unless otherwise specified, calculators are allowed for all assignments, including exams and quizzes.

## Attendance

## Grading Policy

* 40% Homework and quizzes
  * **Note**: This includes online homework, written homework, and quizzes
* 10% Classwork and participation
  * This includes working on problems in small groups and, at times, presenting them on the board
* 10% Problem Presentations (2 **short** explanations of a homework / exam / other challenging problem, submitted online)
* 15% Mid-semester exams (3 exams during the semester, all open-book / notes / untimed)
* 10% Final Exam (open-book / notes / untimed)
* 15% FInal Paper
  * 2% Topic statement (**10/17**)
  * 4% Initial reserach notes / outline (**10/31**)
  * 4% First draft (**11/21**)
  * 5% Final paper (**12/12**)

## Late Homework Policy

Being absent the day that homework is assigned, or the day that it is due, is not an excuse for being late with your homework. If you miss a class, you are expected to email any work that is due that day. I reserve the right to not accept homework assignments late, or to penalize such submissions. In the past, I have given a 50% penalty for late homework assignments.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and projects with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per [Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity).

## Office of Disabilities

The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251- 6035, odr@purchase.edu

## Tutoring

Tutoring is available from the Einstein Corner. Students can make appointments via the Starfish platform. [More information here.](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/)

## Mental Health

update

Please check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/index.php) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
