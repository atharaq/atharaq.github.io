## Course Description

**Prerequisite​**: Precalculus
The basic concepts of the differential and integral calculus. Focus is on the applicability of these topics to an array of problems. The first course in a three-semester series.

## Learning Outcomes

In parentheses below, you can see how the course learning outcomes map to the [Mathematics / CS Program Learning Outcomes](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/about-the-program/program-learning-outcomes/).

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to…

* Understand the concept of a function, and how functions are used to relate quantitative variables (PLO 1, 2)
* Describe functions visually, verbally, algebraically, and numerically (PLO 1, 2)
* Find the limit of a function algebraically and graphically (PLO 2)
* Compute derivatives using several methods (PLO 2)
* Apply techniques of differential calculus to solve problems in several domains (PLO 1, 2)
* Learn the relationship between antiderivatives and definite integrals (PLO 2)
* Explain the importance of calculus in examining topics in current events or historical developments in mathematics (PLO 3, 4, 5)

This course also fulfills the **Core: Mathematics** general education requirements, whose learning outcomes are listed on the [Core Curriculum Learning Outcomes website](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/provost/undergraduate-core-curriculum/student-learning-outcomes/)

## Required Textbook

[*Calculus Volume 1* by Edwin Herman and Gilbert Strang](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1). This textbook is available for free online.

Students who desire additional resources can look into other textbooks, but none of these are required:
* Stewart, *​Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals ​(2nd edition)*. This is a standard (but pricey) textbook for introductory calculus
* Spivak, *​Calculus​ (4th edition)*. This book is for students who are more interested in the rigorous mathematical underpinnings of calculus. This book emphasizes proofs over applications. If you are interested in higher mathematics, this might be worth looking into!
* Courant and John, *​Introduction to Calculus and Analysis I​*. An alternative to the Spivak book, it also is good for students who are interested in higher math.

## Required Software

For written homework assignments, students will need to use either a scanner app or a scanner to create a single PDF of all of their work and upload the work to Moodle. There are several good scanner apps available for Android and iOS devices:
* Scannable (iOS)
* Genius Scan (Android / iOS)
* CamScanner (Android / iOS)

## DeltaMath Online Homework

We will be using the free website **​DeltaMath​** for online homework. To access this software, you can [create a free student account using this link](https://www.deltamath.com/students?code=VZ3Z-2MV9). If the above link does not work, use the following steps:

1. Go to [​www.deltamath.com](https://www.deltamath.com)
2. Click “For students" and then "Register".
3. Enter Teacher Code ​**357935​**.
4. Select MAT 1500 Fall 2022 for “Class” and register using your **purchase.edu** email address please!\

## Calculator Policy

A graphing calculator is required for this course. You are welcome to use online calculators like [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com). If you would like an actual calculator, I recommend getting a TI-83+ or TI-84+. Unless otherwise specified, calculators are allowed for all assignments, including exams and quizzes.

## Attendance

I understand that there may be times you miss a class due to emergencies, illnesses, and other reasons. For this reason, I post the lecture notes online and on Moodle. If you miss a class, be sure to submit any work that was due that day, find out what work you missed, and catch yourself up. You can use my office hours, the LA's office hours, and the tutoring center to help catch you up.

## Late Homework Policy

Mathematics is extremely cumulative, and so it is important to stay on top of your work when it is assigned. If you miss a class or fall behind, you still need to stay on top of the work that was covered. Do your best to stay current with the work, using all the resources at your disposal to help you.

If, due to emergencies or illnesses, you require some flexibility, you can reach out to me and we can discuss what you can do to make things up. However, if you fall behind on work and submit work late, I will have less time to actually look at it, grade it and provide meaningful feedback. If work is submitted too late, I reserve the right to simply give it a zero and move on if I do not have time to look at it.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments and projects with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per [Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity).

## Office of Disabilities

It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035, [odr@purchase.edu](mailto:odr@purchase.edu).

## Tutoring

Tutoring for this course is available from the Einstein Corner. Students can make appointments via the Starfish platform. [More information here.](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/)

## COMMUNITY HEALTH DURING COVID-19:

To ensure that each of us has a healthy and safe learning experience, all students are required to remain informed and follow Purchase College Policy and/or any departmental, local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations for attending classes on campus and in a remote learning environment.

Within courses that involve in-person contact, all students, faculty members, staff, and visitors are required to adhere to the expectations outlined on the [College’s COVID-19 website](https://www.purchase.edu/covid-19-updates-and-plans/). Failure to comply with requirements (e.g. wearing masks, maintaining social distancing where applicable) will result in the request to leave the classroom for that in-person class session. Students may also be referred to the [Office of Community Standards](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/community-standards/).

Do not enter campus buildings if you test positive for or are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. Contact your faculty and [Health Services](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/health-services/index.php) if you need to miss class because of COVID-19 symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test result. The conservatory/school will address on a case by case basis student absences due to COVID-19, while awaiting test results, or during quarantine.

## Wellness and Mental Health

Purchase College has many resources to support our students' wellness and mental health. Please take a look at the [Health and Wellness website](https://www.purchase.edu/campus-life/health-and-wellness/) for more information. In particular, check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
