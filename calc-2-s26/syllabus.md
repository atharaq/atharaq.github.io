## Course Description

**Prerequisite: Calculus I**

Applications include work, growth, and decay problems and volumes of solids of revolution.

## Learning Outcomes

In parentheses below, you can see how the course learning outcomes map to the [Mathematics / CS Program Learning Outcomes](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/about-the-program/program-learning-outcomes/).

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to...

* Use basic derivative facts to compute antiderivatives and definite integrals (PLO 1)
* Compute definite and indefinite integrals by choosing appropriate integration techniques (PLO 1)
* Solve problems in a range of applications using integration, including: (PLO 2)
  * Acceleration problems
  * Finding centroids of regions
  * Areas between curves
  * Volumes of solids of revolution
  * Arc Lengths of curves defined by functions
* Model 2-dimensional motion using parametric equations and polar coordinates (PLO 1, 2)
* Calculate areas and arc lengths of curves given by parametric equations (PLO 1, 2)
* Use convergence tests to determine if an infinite series sums to a finite quantity (PLO 1)
* Use Taylor series to approximate transcendental functions by polynomials (PLO 1)
* Explain how infinite series is used to understand decimal expansions (PLO 3)

## Required Textbook

[*Calculus Volume 2* by Edwin Herman and Gilbert Strang](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2). This textbook is available for free online.

## Required Software

### MyOpenMath Online Homework

We will be using the [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com) website for online homework. Please register ASAP using the Course ID and Enrollment Key provided on **BrightSpace**. Make sure to use your name and Purchase College email address.

## Calculator Policy

A graphing calculator is required for this course. You are welcome to use the Desmos Test Mode app during exams:

* [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/desmos-test-mode/id977381005)
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.desmos.secure&hl=en_US)

If you would like a physical calculator, I recommend the TI-84+ CE or the Casio fx-9750GIII. Unless otherwise specified, calculators are allowed for all assignments, including exams and quizzes.

## Attendance

I understand that there may be times you miss a class due to emergencies, illnesses, and other reasons. For this reason, I post the lecture notes online and on BrightSpace. If you miss a class, be sure to submit any work that was due that day, find out what work you missed, and catch yourself up. You can use my office hours or work with others in class to help catch yourself up.

## Late Homework Policy

Mathematics is extremely cumulative, and so it is important to stay on top of your work when it is assigned. If you miss a class or fall behind, you still need to stay on top of the work that was covered. Do your best to stay current with the work, using all the resources at your disposal to help you.

If, due to emergencies or illnesses, you require some flexibility, you can reach out to me and we can discuss what you can do to make things up. However, if you fall behind on work and submit work late, I will have less time to actually look at it, grade it and provide meaningful feedback. If work is submitted too late, I reserve the right to simply give it a zero and move on if I do not have time to look at it.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments with other students. All individual assignments must be completed on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy: https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity

## Office of Disabilities

It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035, [odr@purchase.edu](mailto:odr@purchase.edu).

## Tutoring

Tutoring is available in the Einstein Corner, located in the Natural Sciences Building room 3046. Studnets can make an appointment via the Starfish platform. [More information here.](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/)

## Wellness and Mental Health

Purchase College has many resources to support our students' wellness and mental health. Please take a look at the [Health and Wellness website](https://www.purchase.edu/campus-life/health-and-wellness/) for more information. In particular, check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
