1. Suppose $\dim(V) = n, \dim(W) = m$ and $T : V \to W$ is linear. What are the dimensions of $M(T)$?

2. Suppose $\dim(V) = 2$ and $\dim(W) = 4$, and $v_1, v_2$ is a basis for $V$, and $w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4$ is a basis for $W$. Let $T : V \to W$ be defined by $T(v_1) = w_1$ and $T(v_2) = w_2$. What is the matrix representation of $T$?

3. Let $P_3$ be the vector space of polynomials of degree at most 3, and $P_2$ the vector space of polynomials of degree at most 2. Let $D : P_3 \to P_2$ be the differentiation function $D(p(x)) = p^\prime(x)$. Find bases for $P_3$ and $P_2$ such that the matrix representation of $D$ with respect to those bases $M(D)$ is $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
