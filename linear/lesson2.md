# Warm Up

1. What is $\Span(\binom{1}{0}, \binom{0}{1})$?
2. What is $\Span(\binom{1}{0}, \binom{0}{1}, \binom{1}{1})$?
3. On one set of axes, draw out as many linear combinations as you can of $\binom{1}{0}$ and $\binom{0}{1}$. On another, draw out as many as linear combinations as you can of $\binom{1}{0}, \binom{0}{1},$ and $\binom{1}{1}$. What differences do you notice?

# Functions

* What is your best definition of a *function*?
* Does your definition change if we talk about different kinds of functions?
  * For example, do we need a different definition for functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and functions $G : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$?
