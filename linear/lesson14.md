With at least one partner, discuss the following: what are all the properties of numbers that allow you to solve the following equation: $$2x + 3 = 9 - x.$$

## Linear Combinations

Recall that we began the semester asking about questions of "reachability". Eventually we defined the notions of linear combinations and spans. The point of the 10 vector space properties is to ensure that linear combinations make sense. For example: the fact that we have closure under addition and scalar multiplication means that if $v, w \in V$, then $3 \cdot v + 4 \cdot w \in V$, so it means that it makes sense to talk about this linear combination.

What about some of the other properties? Associativity of addition means that if we want to talk about $a_1 \cdot v_1 + a_2 \cdot v_2 + a_3 \cdot v_3$, we don't have to worry whether this means $(a_1 \cdot v_1 + a_2 \cdot v_2) + a_3 \cdot v_3$, or $a_1 \cdot v_1 + (a_2 \cdot v_2 + a_3 \cdot v_3)$.

The other properties tell us that scalar multiplication and vector addition "play nicely" with each other. For example, if I rescale a vector by 5, it's the same as, separately, re-scaling the vector by 2 and by 3, and then adding those results. That is exactly what we should expect.
