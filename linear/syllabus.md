## Course Description

**Prerequisite**: Calculus II
Topics include linear equations, row reduction, matrix algebra, determinants, vectors in three dimensions, abstract vector spaces, dimension, linear transformations, eigenvalues, diagonalization, and applications to other sciences.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to...

* Understand the geometry of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$, and their generalizations to abstract vector spaces (PLO 5)
* Understand the definition of linear function, and characterize functions as linear or non-linear (PLO 5)
* Apply various proof techniques, including induction, contradiction, and direct proof, to analyze and construct arguments regarding vector spaces and linear transformations (PLO 3, 5)
* Compute matrix products and explain why the matrix product is defined in that way (PLO 1, 3)
* Compute determinants and explain what they represent (PLO 1, 3)
* Solve linear systems of equations using Gaussian elimination (PLO 1, 2)
* Use knowledge of linear algebra to solve problems from a variety of applications possibly including discrete dynamical systems, differential equations, Google's PageRank algorithm, and network / graph theory (PLO 1, 2, 3)
* Compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a given linear transformation, and explain what they mean (PLO 1, 3, 5)

## Required Textbook

For now, we will be using the following text, available as a free PDF online. [Cherney, Denton, Thomas, and Waldron, *Linear Algebra*](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~linear/linear-guest.pdf)

We may also use readings and exercises from [Grossman, *Linear Algebra in a Nutshell*](https://jp-g.de/Skripte/LA-GES-CS-JPG.pdf).

## Discord Server

Over the past year, some students have found that using a Discord server to chat remotely about coursework was very helpful. I encourage you all to join our Discord server for this course. I will monitor the chat from time to time to help answer questions, but you all should join so you can work with each other!

The link to the Discord server will be available on Moodle.

## Attendance

My expectation is that students come to class as much as possible. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic, I understand when this may be difficult or outright impossible (see the next section on community health). In particular, please do stay home if you feel sick at all. I will do my best to make sure notes, readings, and other materials are available online for those who need them.

That said, please do come to class as much as you can. This will allow me to see how well students understand material, and you to work through problems and questions with each other (and me).

## Community Health During COVID-19

To ensure that each of us has a healthy and safe learning experience, all students are required to remain informed and follow Purchase College Policy and/or any departmental, local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations for attending classes on campus and in a remote learning environment.

Within courses that involve in-person contact, all students, faculty members, staff, and visitors are required to adhere to the expectations outlined on the [College’s COVID-19 website](https://www.purchase.edu/covid-19-updates-and-plans/). Failure to comply with requirements (e.g. wearing masks, maintaining social distancing where applicable) will result in the request to leave the classroom for that in-person class session. Students may also be referred to the [Office of Community Standards](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/community-standards/).

Do not enter campus buildings if you test positive for or are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. Contact your faculty and [Health Services](https://www.purchase.edu/offices/health-services/index.php) if you need to miss class because of COVID-19 symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test result. The conservatory/school will address on a case by case basis student absences due to COVID-19, while awaiting test results, or during quarantine.

## Grading Policy

* 10% Pre-class work and participation (watching videos, short responses)
* 5% Quizzes (3 quizzes)
* 25% Problem Sets (5-7 problem sets)
* 15%: VoiceThread Presentations (3 problem presentations)
* 30%: in-class and/or take-home exams (3 exams)
* 15%: Final paper and presentation

## Late Homework Policy

Being absent the day that homework is assigned, or the day that it is due, is **not** an excuse for being late with your homework. If you miss a class, you are expected to email any work that is due that day. I reserve the right to not accept homework assignments late, or to penalize such submissions. In the past, I have given a 50% penalty for late homework assignments.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to *discuss* homework assignments and problem sets with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per [Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity)

Collaboration is not allowed on any exam, including take-home exams. We will have time in-class for questions about take-home exams.

## Office of Disabilities

It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035, odr@purchase.edu.

## Mental Health

I understand that this is a challenging and stressful time. Please check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/index.php) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
