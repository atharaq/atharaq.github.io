## Disclaimer

Due to the nature of this semester, please note that the syllabus is subject to change. Any changes to the syllabus will be announced either in class or via an announcement posted to Moodle and emailed to the class.

## Course Description

**Prerequisite**: Calculus II
Topics include linear equations, row reduction, matrix algebra, determinants, vectors in three dimensions, abstract vector spaces, dimension, linear transformations, eigenvalues, diagonalization, and applications to other sciences.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to...

(update this)

* Rigorous proofs
* Understanding abstract vector spaces and linear transformations
* Matrix algebra, determinants, row elimination
* Geometric understanding of linear transformations

## Discord Server

Over the past year, some students have found that using a Discord server to chat remotely about coursework was very helpful. I encourage you all to join our Discord server for this course. I will monitor the chat from time to time to help answer questions, but you all should join so you can work with each other!

The link to the Discord server will be available on Moodle.

## Grading Policy

* 10% Pre-class work and participation (watching videos, short responses)
* 5% Quizzes (3 quizzes)
* 25% Problem Sets (5-7 problem sets)
* 15%: VoiceThread Presentations (3 problem presentations)
* 30%: in-class and/or take-home exams (3 exams)
* 15%: Final paper and presentation

## Late Homework Policy

Being absent the day that homework is assigned, or the day that it is due, is **not** an excuse for being late with your homework. If you miss a class, you are expected to email any work that is due that day. I reserve the right to not accept homework assignments late, or to penalize such submissions. In the past, I have given a 50% penalty for late homework assignments.

## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to *discuss* homework assignments and projects with other students. You must complete the assignment on your own, however. There is a clear difference between copying someone else’s work and discussing a problem with another person. The latter is encouraged. Plagiarising another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions as per [Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity)

## Office of Disabilities

The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251- 6035, odr@purchase.edu

## Tutoring

Tutoring is available from the Einstein Corner (virtually or in-person?). Students can make appointments via the Starfish platform. [More information here.](https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/)

**Note**: this is an upper-level course, and so they might not have a tutor who has taken Linear Algebra. I suggest forming study groups with each other, and coming to office hours regularly.

## Mental Health

I understand that this is a challenging and stressful time. Please check the [Counseling Center's website](https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/index.php) to learn about the various services that the Counseling Center has to offer, including remote counseling, emergency resources, hotlines, and referrals. Take care of your mental health!
