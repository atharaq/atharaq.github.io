3D Reachability?


## Functions as Vectors

We can also look at more specific cases of functions:

* If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both **polynomials**, then $f + g$ is a polynomial. (Do you know why?)
* If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both **continuous**, then $f + g$ is continuous. (Why?)
* If they are both **differentiable**?
* If they both have convergent Taylor series?
* If they are both **non-zero**?

One of the above is false. Which one?
